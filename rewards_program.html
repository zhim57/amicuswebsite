              <h3>Rewards Program</h3>
              <p>
                <b> 1. Immediate rewards</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                - We love you,  our customer and think you should be rewarded immediately for each recharge.
                You are our ambassador, you trusted our product and are relying on us to get your data. 
                New customers have one time of sim cost and promotion cost, repeat customers save us these costs 
                when they purchase a voucher. This is why we pass the savings to you. Each $20 and $30 online recharge
                receives 5 %, the $50 recharge receives 10% and the $100 recharge receives 15% bonus airtime.
            </p>
            <b> 2. Longtime customers /loyal customers </b>
            <p>
                - Our long term rewards work in correlation with two multipliers:
               a.  the "continuous years" a customer has been using the PowerSim  
               (a "continuous year" is considered a callendar year that the customer has been using our service 
               with cumulative recharges of a total of $100 or more.)<br>
               b. total cumulative recharges made during this period 
               the formula will take a percentage of the company's last fiscal year profit, divide it by the product of the total customers and the average 
               recharge, the result will be value of a single reward point. then each customer will receive reward points calculated by the cumulative 
               recharge for all his consecutive years , multiplied by the number of his consecutive years. 
               for example it is 2031 calculation and a custmer "A" has 2 consecutive years and $200 cumulative recharge, let's asume that reward points have been calculated to 0.08.so he will receive :200*0.8+1*8 2031 reward.
               and there is a veteran customer "B" with 10 concecutive years and $2200 cumulative recharges during these 10 years . he will receive : (2200*0.08)+9*8= $176+ 72 = $248
              </p>
              <p>
                - provided that both customers have $100 in cumulative recharges in 2031, then it looks we will be paying to our longterm customers?
              </p>
              <p>
                - yes, and we should pay them , if a person has stayed with us as a loyal customer for several consecutive years , the chances are at 
                some point his rewardswill start exceeding the cumulative rechrges he has made during the year.
